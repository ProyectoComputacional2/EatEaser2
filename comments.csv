pB2Yf-EewJs,"I was brought here because of my love and admiration for sushi. You kept me here by just being you. You put our a ton of free, and otherwise expensive, knowledge out there. You have a kind and honest persona. You're easy to look at and watch. Your edits are really nice and you use very refreshing and chill-type music. And, last but not least, you make sushi more than just an art to show off to other people; you make it so it's possible others can do the same thing. One of the things on my bucket list is to grab a small crew and go around meeting all of the people I admire on my YouTube channel, then documenting it and see their reactions and such. I don't plan to meet everyone that I am subscribed to... just saying though, it would be fun to give the same courtesy to others as they do for the ""youtube"" community. ",0.0,0.847,0.153,0.9756

Do you think a rounded up roll of rice (open faced, maybe even double layered with a sliver of nori in the middle) inside of this sushi creation of yours would be a good idea? 
Maybe give it structure, add texture or something? Comment below for an answer to me. Thanks!",0.0,0.882,0.118,0.8202
