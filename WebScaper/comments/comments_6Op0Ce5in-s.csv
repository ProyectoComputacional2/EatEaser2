"Holy shit - I just started watching a bunch of your videos and all were pre 2019. Just watched this one and realized it's from 2 days ago. Good to see you're still uploading content (great content!) Thanks for all of it. As someone who picked up the art of sushi making during the pandemic, I enjoy watching chefs like you and Chef Hiroyuki Terada's channels. Thanks again!!!",0.043,0.724,0.233,0.9439

"Hey Chef Devaux, it's me again, 440, with a question to keep that comment count up.
Do you think a rounded up roll of rice (open faced, maybe even double layered with a sliver of nori in the middle) inside of this sushi creation of yours would be a good idea? 
Maybe give it structure, add texture or something? Comment below for an answer to me. Thanks!",0.0,0.882,0.118,0.8202
