"I was brought here because of my love and admiration for sushi. You kept me here by just being you. You put our a ton of free, and otherwise expensive, knowledge out there. You have a kind and honest persona. You're easy to look at and watch. Your edits are really nice and you use very refreshing and chill-type music. And, last but not least, you make sushi more than just an art to show off to other people; you make it so it's possible others can do the same thing. One of the things on my bucket list is to grab a small crew and go around meeting all of the people I admire on my YouTube channel, then documenting it and see their reactions and such. I don't plan to meet everyone that I am subscribed to... just saying though, it would be fun to give the same courtesy to others as they do for the ""youtube"" community. ",0.0,0.847,0.153,0.9756

Chef Devaux instructional videos on to do it yourself sushi making for home cooks is indeed a unique added value. I highly recommend all sushi hobbyists to watch and follow him for his simplicity and perfection in an art that has been so far considered as being extremely difficult and complicated.

It's a combination of entertainment and education for me. I enjoy watching you make things because of how relaxed you are and that you use SI units! But also you of course teach the different varieties of sushi rolls. I like making what you show also. Greetings from Canada!,0.0,0.763,0.237,0.9124

Your tutorials are quick, easy to follow, utilize great camera angles and you are articulate; but never annoyingly ""talky.""  You have really inspired me to actually try several of your recipes (Sushi Doughnuts, Cucumber Whale, Tinted Sushi Rice)...and they came out great! You are so much fun to watch; killer smile and fun personality.  Thank you for sharing your sushi-making skills and wonderful recipes.  Your fan in Covina, CA.   Martha",0.044,0.604,0.352,0.9917

I've never seen things like the wasabi flower, ginger salsa, the soy foam, the panda roll and (my new favorite) the cucumber whale before. I also love your plating and garnishing. You make one of the most delicious foods so visually appealing that it's impossible to not keep watching. ",0.025,0.642,0.333,0.99
